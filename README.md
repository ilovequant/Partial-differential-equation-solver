# fluid_structural-dynamics-solver
This MATLAB code is used to visualize the pressure and velocity field of a fluid domain at the presence of a vibrating eulerian beam. The solver uses finite difference for solving the 4-th order differential equation of the beam. The fluids was implemented according to analytical derivation and was coupled to the structural vibration.
